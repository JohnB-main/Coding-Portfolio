THIS IS THE README DOCUMENT FOR THE ASSIGNMENT3 CODE.

THE CODE SHOULD BE RUN IN A PYTHON APPLICABLE PROGRAM.

THE CODE IS MEANT TO RUN ON ITS OWN, THERE IS NO INTERACTION WITH THE USER BESIDES
	THE PRESSING OF THE RUN BUTTON.

THE CODE WILL RUN THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, EACH QUESTION IS SEPARATED BY A DIVIDER IN THE RESULT OUTPUT TAB.

QUESTION 1'S CODE PORTION USES A CIRCULAR DOUBLE-ENDED QUEUE AND TESTS DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON THAT QUEUE.
	QUESTION ONE WILL PRINT TRUE, IF OPERATIONS ARE SUCCESFUL; FLASE, IF THE OPERATION
	DID NOT WORK; OR A NUMBER FOR THE GET FUNCTIONS.
		THE GET FUNCTIONS RETURN A -1 WHEN THE QUEUE IS EMPTY

QUESTION 2'S CODE MERGES TWO SORTED LINKED-LISTS INTO A NEW, SORTED LINKED LIST.

QUESTION 3'S CODE CREATES A LINKED-LIST QUEUE WITH MORE OPERATIONS THAN THE QUEUE IN QUESTION 1, INCLUDING A SEARCH OPTION.
	THE OPERATIONS OF QUESTION 3 WILL PRINT A NUMBER, IF DEQUEUE, FIRST, OR LENGTH ARE CALLED;
	TRUE OR FALSE FOR IS_EMPTY OR A SEARCH. THE OUTPUT CAN ALSO HAVE EMPTY QUEUE THROWS.
