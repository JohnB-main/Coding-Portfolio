THIS PROGRAM MUST BE RUN IN A PYTHON COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE.

THIS PROGRAM WILL DO TWO QUESTIONS FOR ASSIGNMENT 4.

THE QUESTIONS ARE DIVIDED BY CODE PRINTED IN THE OUTPUT.

ALL EXAMPLES ARE PREMADE, SO TO CHANGE THE RESULTS ONE MUST CHANGE THE CODE.

QUESTION 1: IN-PLACE SORTS A HEAP AND RETURNS THE SORTED VERSION; AND CREATES A MAXHEAP AND REMOVES THE MAX UNTIL THE HEAP IS EMPTY.

QUESTION 2: PRINTS THE SIZE OF THE PREMADE HEAP, WHETHER IT IS EMPTY OR NOT, AND THEN THE ARRAY BY REMOVEMIN.
		A NEW LIST IS THEN PRINTED BY USING THE BUILD_HEAP FUNCTION. THE FUNCTION USES
		THE NUMBERS FROM QUESTION #1.


*THIS CODE WAS DERIVED FROM IN CLASS EXAMPLES.
