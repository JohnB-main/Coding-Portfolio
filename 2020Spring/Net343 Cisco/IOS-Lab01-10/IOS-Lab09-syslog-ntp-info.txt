TO-DO: Sim Activities for eXtending the initial configurations

Sim Activities for eXtending the initial configurations

+ Use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for setting the clock on a network device, 
and add a Syslog server for recording events of interest on a network
For this update the server system name label to serversCorp, verify its IP address is 10.10.90.2/24, 
and enable the Syslog service

+ On router rCorp send logging event to the Syslog server for all levels, synchronize to 
NTP clock and add time stamps to events

+ Enable logging of ping (icmp) traffic to rCorp

+ From computer c1Corp ping router rCorp and view the Syslog files. 
Note event time stamps.

+ Turn debugging off on rCorp

+ Copy running configs to startup configs of devices

+ Save the sim adding your our name to it, such as 
IOS-Lab09-syslog-ntp-x--MyName 

----------------------------------
INITIAL CONFIGURATIONS:
On the Router:
running-config and startup-config identical 
Router name - rCorp
IPs set on Fa0/0 interface 10.10.90.1/24 and it is up
16 vty (telnet/ssh) lines 0 - 15 available, login required and passwor is: net
User exec mode password: net
Privilege exec mode password: 343
MOTD and Login banners set
ip hostname rC 10.10.90.1

On the Switch:
running-config and startup-config identical 
Switch name - s1Corp
All 24 FastEthernet, and 2 Gig interfaces enabled
Management native default vlan 1 (all ports belong to it) shutdown
16 vty (telnet/ssh) lines 0-15 available, login required but no password set
Management vlan 1 10.10.90.3/24
TFTP, HTTP, NTP servers 10.10.l90.2/24 added to switch at Fa0/2
----------------------------------
IMPLEMENTED: Sim Activities for eXtending the initial configurations

+ Use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for setting the clock on a network device, 
and add a Syslog server for recording events of interest on a network

+ Update the server system, name label to serversCorp, verify its IP address is 10.10.90.2/24, 
and enable the Syslog service
(Click tftp_http_ntpCorp name labe and change)
(Click serversCorp -> Config tab -> Under Interface FastEthernet0) verify IP and subnet mask
(Services tab -> Verify Syslog service is on)

+ On router rCorp send logging event to the Syslog server for all levels, synchronize to 
NTP clock and add time stamps to events
rCorp(config)#logging 10.10.90.2
rCorp(config)#logging trap debugging
rCorp(config)#logging on
rCorp(config)#ntp server 10.10.90.2
rCorp(config) service timestamps log datetime msec

+ Enable logging of ping (icmp) traffic to rCorp
rCorp#debug ip icmp

+ From computer c1Corp ping router rCorp and view the Syslog files. Note event time stamps.

+ Turn debugging off on rCorp
rCorp#no debug ip icmp
(or may use the "undebug all" command)

+ Copy running configs to startup configs of devices
rCorp#copy run start

+ Save the sim adding your our name to it, such as IOS-Lab09-syslog-ntp-x--MyName

UPDATED CONFIGURATIONS ADDED
On the Switch:
Syslog server (10.10.90.2/24) added to s1Corp
