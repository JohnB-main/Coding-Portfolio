TO-DO: Sim Activities for eXtending the initial configurations

+ Setup a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server for hosting web pages, update its name label to
 tftp_httpCorp, verify IP and subnet mask as 10.10.90.2/24

+ Verify that the web server can can access the web page it is hosting
In the URL field enter the IP address of the HTTP server

+ Verify that a web broswer on computer c1Corp can  access the web page hosted on the
tftp_httpCorp web server. In the URL field enter the IP address of the HTTP server

+ Make suitable changes to the "index.html" file on the web server.
Click on the edit button next to the index.html file and find the phrase -- Welcome to Cisco Packet Tracer.
 Add "in the NET 343 class" to it and save this file. View the changes both locally and over the network.
 
+ Save the modified index.html file and verify that the changes are displayed on the web page both 
locally (on server itself) and over the network (from c1Corp).

+ Save the sim adding your our name to it, such as IOS-IOS-Lab07-http-x--MyName
