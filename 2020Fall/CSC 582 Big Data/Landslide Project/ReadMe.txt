# Landslide Project ReadMe

Four files are included:
	.jpg = proof of the script running on my computer and producing a dataset and a plot
	.R = the R file that produced the results for my project and did the data processing
	.csv = the original dataset that all of my research is focused on


To run the R code, put it into a R compiler (I used RStudio) 
	you may run only certain sections as long as you run the dependent sections as well
Run all the lines of code (don't forget to set the working directory to where the .csv file is)

The R file is commented to describe what each small section of code does
Most sections of the code create a dataset that is used in another portion
