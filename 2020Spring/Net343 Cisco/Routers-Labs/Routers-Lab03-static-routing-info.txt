IMPLEMENTED: Sim Activities for eXtending the initial configurations
First copy the Routers-Lab03-static-routing-i to Routers-Lab03-static-routing-x-MyName

+ From c10Corp ping the near end of its serial interface (10.10.91.2) and
 the far/WAN end (10.10.91.1).

+ From c12Branch ping its gateway and back to verify connectivity.

+ From c12Branch ping the near end of the serial interface (10.10.91.2) and the far/WAN end of the serial link (10.10.91.1).

+ Next, we will be setting up static routing between the systems. 
View the routing tables on both rCorp and rBranch.

+ On rCorp:
rCorp(config)#ip route 10.10.92.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.91.2 150
rCorp(config)#end
rCorp#show ip route

+ On rBranch:
rBranch(config)#ip route 10.10.90.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.91.1 150
rBranch(config)#ip route 10.10.93.0 255.255.255.0 s0/0 150
rBranch(config)#end
rBranch#show ip route

+ From c12Branch ping c10Corp and c11Corp2; and from c10Corp 
ping c12Branch.

+ Launch a web browser at c12Branch and vew the default web page 
at 10.10.90.2

+ Remove the static route set on rCorp for the
 10.10.92.0/24 network through 10.10.91.1
rCorp(config)#no ip route 10.10.92.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.91.2 150

+ Next, set the Gateway of Last Resort on rCorp to
 forward network traffice to 10.10.92.1 and verify
rCorp#config t
rCorp(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.91.2
rCorp(config)#end
rCorp#show ip route

+ Verify that pings across the network still work between hosts, and that 
c12Branch can still veiw the web page hosted on webServerCorp.

+ Remove all static routing setup between rCorp and rBranch

+ (Optional) Decide if you would like set up static routes between the
 networks using either: next-hop IP  address, or Outgoing-interace, or 
Gateway of last resort on the two routers, and apply these.

+ Copy running configs of rCorp and rBranch to startup configs

+ Save the sim adding your name to it, such as Routers-Lab03-static-routing-x--MyName
