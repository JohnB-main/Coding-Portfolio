   <h1>Our Lovely Purpose</h1>
    <p>The purpose of Borderlands 3 Gunnage is to create a public place for Borderlands 3 players to record the legendary weapons they have found. This site is less about helping players find legendaries in the game, but more for learning what legendaries may exist in Borderlands 3.
        <br /><br />
        This site will allow you to search for guns with different criteria, and even submit your own! 
        <br /><br />
        Enjoy!
        <br /><br />
        Aside: Borderlands is a shoot-n-loot game series that relies on random chance to get new guns from enemies the players kill. Some of these guns are very special and are called Legendaries. Those legendary guns are what this site will record.
        <br />Borderlands 3 released in 2019 for multiple consoles and PC.
